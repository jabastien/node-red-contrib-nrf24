# Node-Red freedom for nRF24l01 / nRF24l01+ radios

This package implement Node-RED nodes for using __nRF24L01 / nRF24l01+__ radios easy, fast and with typical NODE-Red flow semantics. This will enable NODE-RED flows to receive and send data to sensors and controllers (such arduinos or other mcus based appliances) and integrate them with complex logic and outstanding presentation and charting capabilities of Node-Red.

This module is based on *nodejs* package __nrf24__. Please check [here](https://github.com/ludiazv/node-nrf24) the full documentation about how to wire and configure SPI interfaces of your Raspberry Pi or other Single Board computers (SBCs) such Orange Pis, NanoPi , BeagleBone,...

 The package provide the following functionality:

- Basic __nRF24L01 / nRF24l01+__ communication via input and output nodes.
- Create or join a __RF24Mesh__ network with a simple node.  (In testing)
- Deploy directly a __RF24Ethernet__ gateway to enable to provide TCP/IP conectivity to arduinos an sensors via __nRF24L01__ radios. *(In development)*

## Installation

Run the follwing commands under ``$HOME/.node-red``.

```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-nrf24

```

If you experience any problems try to install __nrf24__ first:

```bash
npm install nrf24
npm install node-red-contrib-nrf24

```

Installation via palette is not recommended. Base library require *root* access and compilation of binaries.

After installation node-red need to be restarted to load the new installed nodes. The new nodes will be available under ``nRF24l01`` category in the palette.

## Prerequisites

The package is written in pure javascript following coding standards of Node-RED. It depends, however, on __nrf24__ module that is and C++ add-on that require custom build.

Please check the the __prerequisites__ of __nrf24__ [here](https://github.com/ludiazv/node-nrf24) to validate your installation. It should cover:

- Wiring and GPIO mapping.
- Base nrf24 libray installation.
- nrf24 package installation.

## Usage

The usage of nodes is similar to standard Node-RED nodes:

1. Place de node on your flow
2. Click on the created node to configure it.
3. Connect inputs/outputs to your flow logic.
4. Deploy the nodes/flow.

## Vanilla RF24 radio communication

Check out this simple example of an echo/relay service:

![rf24 example](images/rf24-example-flow.png?raw=true)

Only Two nodes are required to implement the radio communication. The first node listen to radio frames and emits them over it's sole output. The payloads received are wired to the output node that delivers back to the radio. Simple as pie. This to nodes are equivalent to dozens of lines of code without any programing and Node-RED freedom.

### The radio configuration node (rf24radio)

The radio harware is represented in Node-RED using a ["configuration node"](https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/config-nodes) where all the information wiring and physical interface is defined.

Configuration nodes can be created directly from input or output nodes or via Node-Red "Configuration nodes" menu and then associate the radio node to Input or outputs nodes.

The radio configuration node has the following fields to be filled:
![radio-props](images/radio-props.png?raw=true)

| Field       | Description                         | Default | Notes          |
| -----       | -------------------------------     | -       | -------------- |
| Name        | *optional* Name of the node         | empty   ||
| CS          | GPIO number SPI CS                  |   0     | [1](1) |
| CE          | GPIO number of CE line              |  25     | [1](1) |
| IRQ         | GPIO number of IRQ line             |  -1     | [3](3) |
| PA Level    | Power Signal Min,Low,High,Max,Ultra |  Max    | Ultra is only compatible with Si24R1 clone radios |
| Data Rate   | Speed of radio communications       |  1Mbps  | Valid 1Mpbs,2Mbps,250Kbps [2](2) |
| Payload size | Size in bytes of the data frame     |  32     | 1-32 bytes |
| Channel     | Radio channel to use  (0-126)     |  76      | Valid 0-126 [2](2) |
| Retry Delay | uSeconds between hardware retries   |  15      | valid 0-15     |
| Retry Count | Number of retry attempts            |  15      | valid 0-15. 0= no retries |
| CRC         | CRC error checking                  |  16bit   | none,8bit,16bit |
| Polling     | Polltime in us                      |  40,000  | [3](3) |

All parameters are __mandatory__ if optional not stated.

[1]: Check __nrf24__  [here](https://github.com/ludiazv/node-nrf24) documentation about CS/CE wiring.

[2]: Two devices are able to communicate via radio if they use the __same channel and the same data rate__.

[3]: IRQ -1 means IRQ is not used and Polling time will be used to poll the status of the radio. Poll time need to be >4ms (4,000us) to avoid CPU congestion. Chosing a short poll time will consume CPU cycles polling, converselly long polling time could represent the loss o radio packets.

### Reading frames/packets (rf24input)

To read frames sent over the radio an __rf24input__ node need to placed in your flow. This node represent a *reading pipe* in __nRF24L01__ terminology. A pipe is a virtual one-way channel of communication between radios. If a device write to a pipe, all radios listening in that pipe will receive the packet.

>__Caveat__: In this implementation only 40-bit (5-bytes) pipe numbers are supported as recommended by __nRF24L01__ manufacturer.

Configuring an input node require only few parameters:

![input-props](images/input-props.png?raw=true)

| Field       | Description                         | Default | Notes          |
| -----       | -------------------------------     | -       | -------------- |
| Name        | *optional* Name of the node         | empty   | |
| RF24 Radio  | Radio to use (reference)            |         | refers to config node |
| Topic       | Node-RED topic name                 | nrf24   | |
| Remote Addr | Pipe ID for reading                 | 0x65646f4e31 | Remote address must be a 5 byte(40-bit) Hex number with format 0xhhhhhhhhhh |
| Auto-Ack    | Enable hardware `Ack` upon frame receive | true | |
| Output to string | Enable conversion of radio frame to string | false |  |

>__Caveat__: Up to 5 Input nodes can be used with one radio. This is a hardware limit. On the other hand one more that one input is used only the First byte can be change.

When the node is deployed the status flags will show if the input node is properly configured. Indicating the address and the number of received frames.

When the radio receive a frame the input node will emit a Node-RED message on it's output with the following structure:

```javascript
{ _msgid: "...." ,
  topic: "<configured topic>",
  pipeID: <id number>,
  pipeAddress: "00xhhhhhhhhhh with the pipe Address",
  payload: <Buffer with the data> or "<string with the data>" if 'output as string is selected'
}

```

### Writing frames/packets (rf24ouput)

In a similar way as the input node. The output node enable to send information over the radio in a *writing pipe*.

Configuring the node require a minimal parametrization:
![output-props](images/output-props.png?raw=true)

| Field       | Description                         | Default | Notes          |
| -----       | -------------------------------     | -       | -------------- |
| Name        | *optional* Name of the node         | empty   | |
| RF24 Radio  | Radio to use (reference)            |         | refers to config node |
| Topic       | Node-RED topic name                 | nrf24   | |
| Remote Addr | Pipe ID for reading                 | 0x65646f4e31 | Remote address must be a 5 byte(40-bit) Hex number with format 0xhhhhhhhhhh
| Auto-Ack    | Enable hardware `Ack` upon frame receive | true | |

>__Caveat:__ Radio hardware only enable __one__ writing pipe enabled. You can however use several output nodes with different pipe addresses. The nodes will manage to switch writing pipes autonomously. If you need to control the priority or order in writing to different use the __'pipeAddressW'__ property described below.

In order to send message over the radio you need to inject a Node-RED message into the sole input of the node using the following format:

```javascript
{
  payload: <Buffer or string>
  ...
  <other properties will be ignored>
}

```

This will deliver the data to the *pipe* defined on the node. The payload can be *nodejs* buffer or a string and it will be croped to the maximum payload size defined in the radio configuration.

A single node can deliver radio payloads to any pipe dynamically. To do that the input message need to have a valid *pipe address* string included in the message. With the follwing format:

```javascript
{
  payload: <Buffer or string>,
  pipeAddressW: "000xhhhhhhhhhh"
  ...
  <other properties will be ignored>
}

```
